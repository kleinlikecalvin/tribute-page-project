          <em>
            Streetlight Manifesto
          </em>
          is an American ska punk band from New Brunswick, New Jersey, United
          States, formed in 2002. They released their first album, Everything
          Goes Numb, which was distributed by Victory Records, on August 26,
          2003. The band headlined and sold out their first concert at Rutgers
          University in New Brunswick, New Jersey on December 9, 2003. Several
          of Streetlight Manifesto's members were well known in the New Jersey
          third wave ska community for their roles in past ska punk bands from
          that area, primarily Kalnoky's Catch 22 and fellow New Jersey band One
          Cool Guy.

        A Sample of Their Amazing Wordsmithing:
      </h5>
      <blockquote>
        <em>
          "The sudden rush you feel when realizing everything you know will fade
          away, it haunts you, dear, but you wonâ€™t want to let it go. Someday
          we'll lose the war, but until then we will dream of winning. I wonâ€™t
          forget the things you said when I was down and I was tired of it. The
          words you spoke, they brought me hope. When it was time to fight we
          chose a side, but everyone knew that something didn't feel right. So
          we stood our ground and waited for a sign."
        </em>
